# Comprehensive SAR Guidance (Industry-Standard)

## Purpose
This document provides standardized guidance for determining when a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) should be filed, aligned with common regulatory expectations (e.g., FinCEN, FATF principles). It is intended to support **investigator decision-making**, not to automate filings.

## Core Principles
- **Reasonable Suspicion**: File when facts indicate potential money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or other financial crimes.
- **Totality of Evidence**: Decisions must consider all available evidence holistically.
- **Timeliness**: SARs should be filed within required regulatory timeframes once suspicion is formed.
- **Consistency & Defensibility**: Similar fact patterns should result in similar outcomes.

## SAR Filing Criteria
A SAR should generally be filed when:
- Activity is inconsistent with the customer’s known profile or expected behavior, AND
- There is no reasonable, documented benign explanation, AND
- Indicators align with known financial crime typologies.

## Common Red Flags
- Structuring to evade reporting thresholds
- Rapid movement of funds with no economic purpose
- Use of high-risk jurisdictions without business rationale
- Unusual velocity or volume relative to expected activity
- Complex layering through multiple accounts/entities

## Documentation Expectations
- Clear narrative summarizing who, what, when, where, why, and how
- Explicit linkage between transactions and suspicion
- Reference to investigative steps taken and sources reviewed

## Non-Filing Scenarios
A SAR may not be required when:
- Activity is explained by legitimate business operations
- Alerts are driven by data quality issues
- Thresholds are crossed without suspicious intent

## Quality Assurance Checklist
- Are facts clearly separated from assumptions?
- Is evidence cited for each claim?
- Would an external reviewer reach the same conclusion?

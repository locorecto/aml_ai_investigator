# SAR Narrative Best Practices

## Purpose
The SAR narrative is the most critical component of the filing. It must clearly articulate suspicion and supporting evidence.

## Structure
1. **Subject Information**
2. **Summary of Suspicious Activity**
3. **Detailed Transaction Description**
4. **Why the Activity is Suspicious**
5. **Actions Taken by the Institution**

## Writing Guidelines
- Be concise and factual
- Avoid jargon and speculation
- Use chronological order
- Clearly state why activity is suspicious

## Evidence Referencing
- Reference transaction IDs and dates
- Quantify amounts and frequencies
- Tie observations to known typologies

## Common Pitfalls
- Vague language
- Missing timelines
- Failure to explain why activity is suspicious

## QA Checklist
- Would a regulator understand the activity without additional context?
- Are all claims supported by evidence?
